            <h2>about me</h2>
            <div class="aboutMe">
                <p>Throughout my career I have dived deep into many worlds: <span>IT, product management, marketing,
                        design
                        and education</span>. The last six years as a primary Computing teacher have helped me to
                    rediscover my
                    passion in Computer Science, the thrill of problem solving and the satisfaction of creating digital
                    designs. Now I am ready to steer my career back into IT and become a software developer.</p>

                <p>An <span>avid self-learner</span>, I am currently in the process of bringing my programming skills up
                    to date,
                    learning Python, JavaScript and other skills to become a full-stack engineer. Initially daunted by
                    the large time gap in my CV, I realise now that programming is like riding a bicycle: languages have
                    evolved and new technologies have risen, but the <span>problem-solving</span> skills I developed
                    studying for my
                    degree at Edinburgh University are still there. I realise that the best way to learn in on-the-job
                    and know that, given the opportunity, I will be able to ramp up my skills swiftly and become a
                    productive team member at your company.</p>
